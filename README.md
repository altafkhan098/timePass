# Student Portal Webpage

This is a simple **Student Portal** webpage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides an easy-to-navigate platform with sections like Home, Courses, Profile, and Contact. The webpage includes interactive features such as toggling profile details and showing an alert on button click.

When I'm bored, I create things like this! It's a fun and simple project that I put together to learn more about web development.

## Features

- **Home Section**: A welcoming message and a brief introduction to the portal.
- **Courses Section**: A list of available courses with a "View More" button that triggers an alert.
- **Profile Section**: Toggle visibility of user profile details with a button.
- **Contact Section**: A simple contact section with an email link for support.

## Prerequisites

To run this webpage, you'll need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)


## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

- **Header Section**: Contains the webpage title and navigation links to different sections.
- **Sections**: 
  - `Home`: A brief welcome message.
  - `Courses`: A list of courses with a button that triggers an alert.
  - `Profile`: User profile details, which can be toggled visible or hidden.
  - `Contact`: A simple contact section with an email link.

### CSS (`styles.css`)

- The CSS file is used to style the webpage, providing:
  - A clean, minimalistic design.
  - A green-themed navigation bar and buttons.
  - Section styling with padding, margins, and background colors.
  - Hover effects on buttons for interactivity.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

- **showMessage()**: This function triggers an alert when the "View More" button in the Courses section is clicked.
- **toggleProfile()**: This function toggles the visibility of the user's profile details when the "Toggle Profile Details" button is clicked.

## Customization

You can easily customize the webpage by editing the following:

- **Content**: Update the text inside each section to reflect your own content (e.g., courses, student names, etc.).
- **Styling**: Modify the `styles.css` file to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Functionality**: Add new interactive features by extending the JavaScript code.
